This folder contains the classification models which I have developed for the Social Network Ads dataset.So I have taken this dataset and have done analysis and built various classification models and have compared the accuracies of all the models.
So I have plotted graphs for these different models and by these visualizations we can predict if a person of a particular age is likely to buy a car or not.
