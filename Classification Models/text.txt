This folder contains the classification models which I have developed for the Social Network Ads dataset.So I have taken this dataset and have done analysis and built various classification models and have compared the accuracies of all the models.
So I have plotted graphs for these different models and by these visualizations we can predict if a person of a particular age is likely to buy a car or not.We train our models on the training set and test it on the test set and also give the error metrics and display the confusion matrix to see where our model has done incorrect predictions.So I have done various classification algorithms and have acquired accuracies above 85% for all the models.
