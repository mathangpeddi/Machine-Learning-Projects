This folder contains all the regression techniques which I have used for various real world datasets.So I have taken 3 real-world datasets and have applied various regression algorithms like simple linear,multiple linear and polynomial regression.I even have a basic idea about Ridge regression and lasso regression.So I have done the analysis,plotting of various curves based on the data points and have given appropriate conclusions and insights. We calculate the error metrics for these models and create confusion matrix to see where our model has done incorrect predictions.So we first train the model on our training set and then test it on the test set.In all these models I have tried my best and achieved around 90% accuracy in all the models.
