# Supervised Learning
   ## • Regression
   For the Simple Linear Regression model I have used the Salary dataset where I had to predict the Salary of a person based on his years of experience. For the Multiple Linear Regression model I have used the 50Startups dataset where I had to predict the Profit based on various features-which included numerical as well as categorical variables. Then I have taken the PositionSalaries dataset where I had to predict the Salary of a person based on his level. For the Ridge,Lasso Regression I have used the inbuilt dataset which is the Boston dataset where we try to predict the prices of houses in various locations in Boston. So the different regression algorithms used are:
   <ul>
     <li>Linear Regression</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
         <li>Simple Linear Regression</li>
         <li>Multiple Linear Regression</li>
         <li>Polynomial Regression</li>
    </ul>
     <li>Support Vector Regression</li>
     <li>Decision Tree Regression</li>
     <li>Random Forest Regression</li>
     <li>Ridge Regression</li>
     <li>Lasso Regression</li>
   </ul>
   
   ## • Classification
 This is the Social Networks Ads dataset which consists of 400 obersvations corresponding to 400 columns. Each row is a customer and for each of them we take only the 2 features Age and estimated salary(as UserId and gender are not of much importance to us) with which we are going to predict this dependent variable which tells if he has purchased the car or not(yes or no). So first we take the dataset and split it into training and test sets and then train this model to understand the correlations between these features and the dependent variable vector we will be able to predict which new customer will buy that brand new SUV just released by this car company and therefore  make predictions on the test set and compare it with the actual values and calculate the accuracy. The different classification algorithms used are:
   <ul>
    <li>Logistic Regression</li>
    <li>K Nearest Neighbours (KNN)</li>
    <li>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</li>
    <li>Kernel SVM</li>
    <li>Naive Bayes</li>
    <li>Decision Tree Classification</li>
    <li>Random Forest Classification</li>
   </ul>
 Out of all the models,the best classifier is the kernel SVM because it showed a smooth curve and properly differentiated the red and the green regions. The linear classifier was not so good,the random forest and decision tree are having many irregularities. So considering the accuracy and the plot, the kernel SVM was the best fit/classifier for this business problem.
